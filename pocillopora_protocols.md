# Pocillopora spawning and larval assessment protocols

## 1) Spawning Observations
[Harnay and Putnam 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.05.558016v1.full)

The spawning observation site is located on the north shore lagoon reef in Moorea (-17.475757, -149.808062). All observations should be made while snorkeling at ∼1-3m, with a minimum of two observers in the water. Observers should be positioned to simultaneously visualize multiple morphologies (e.g., P. meandrina, P. tuahinensis, P. verrucosa, P. grandis). Pocillopora spp spawning observations to date have been made between ~6:00 and 6:50 in Moorea. Once an observation of spawning is made, complete the following:    

(A) Tag the colonies using a plastic cattle tag and ziptie and geolocate via GPS

(B) Film spawning when possible and photograph each colony with a color and size standard

(C) Collect a tissue biopsy from each tagged colony in a sterile Whirlpak with the same tag number as the colony

## 2) Gamete Collection and Gamete Mixing

As soon as the colony is tagged and as the colony is spawning, open an empty collection bottle (1-2L nalgene wide mouth bottle) next to the spawning colony to use the negative pressure to pull as many gametes as possible into the bottle. Cap the bottle and return in to your mesh bag until you complete the spawning observations and return to the boat. 

In the boat mix all of the bottles collected into a single container. Let them sit for 5 minutes and then return them to their individual containers until you reach the lab at Gump.  Once back at Gump, prepare clean squaricals for static rearing. Place ~10L of the collected water and gamete mix into as many squaricals as needed for the water volume. Top off each to the same volume using 0.2µm FSW. Place the squaricals in a running water table that acts as a water bath to maintain temperatures. 



## 3) Embryo Rearing

Place the squaricals in a running water table that acts as a water bath to maintain temperatures. Measure pH, salinity, and temperature at least 3 times per day. 

## 4) Embryo Collections
Using the 50ml falcon tube filters, concentrate the larvae on the filter by pouring 250ml through the filter. Collect the following from the concentrated sample:

### 4A - Formalin Fixation
Collect 50µl into each of 2 tubes for formalin fixation. Add 200µl of 10% formalin immediately to stop development in order to quantify stage later using microscopy. Store samples in the 4°C fridge. When you have time on the microscope, remove ~50 embryos from each tube and image them using a slide micrometer or hemocytometer for scale. 
	
### 4B - RNA/DNA Preservation
Collect 250µl into each of 6 tubes for RNA/DNA Preservation. Add 500µl of RNA DNA Sheild and store at -40°C.
